	<h2>An introduction to Bangkok</h2>
		<p>Thailand is more or less centrally located in S.E. Asia, so as to say; conveniently located to industrial sources from China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan, Korea, etc.. Because of this, it's low labor costs, sea ports in the Gulf of Thailand and a number of other factors make it attractive to industry; particularly manufacturing and exports which accounts for about two-thirds of Thailand's GDP. There are many major automotive and hi-tech manufacturers that have made a home in the industrial areas surrounding Bangkok.
		</p>
		<p>It is also well known for it's tourism. Bangkok is one of many tourism "hot spots" in Thailand along with notable coastal destinations like Phuket &#40;pronounced: poo-ket&#41;. This country very much lends itself to the tireless globetrotter with hundreds of destinations geared to travelers and Bangkok takes the term "city that never sleeps" to a whole new level! The sights, sounds and smells of this city are exotic and there seems to be a little something for everyone: beautiful architecture, fascinating tours of ancient landmarks, coral reefs, white sand beaches with crystal waters, shopping, exotic food, big-city night life; you name it, it can be found here.
		</p>
		<p>Unlike so many other countries whose society and culture is largely influenced by western culture in every respect; Thailand is still very unique and while there is some familiarity for the westerner &#40;they drive on the right side, they have Starbucks and MacDonalds, etc.&#41;, it is every bit it's own country so make sure to read through the <a href="#PitLink"><b>Pitfalls</b></a> section of this page carefully.

		<h3>Places to Crash</h3>
		<div id="Crash">
		  <ol>
			<li><a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/bkkqp-bangkok-marriott-marquis-queen%E2%80%99s-park/">Bangkok Marriott Marquis Queen's Park</a> This massive hotel is beautiful inside and out; it is backed by The Queen's Park, a beautiful expanse of garden, park and pond. Located in the middle of Bangkok, it is very close to countless shops and restaurants and even has quite a few inside the hotel itself. I have never been to a better buffet, it was simply enormous and had a little bit of everything you could think of!</li>
			<li><a href="http://siam-bangkok.anantara.com/?utm_source=TripadvisorBusinessListing&utm_medium=MHGCorporate&utm_term=Siam&utm_content=Home&utm_campaign=Tripadvisor1Y">Antara Siam Bangkok Hotel</a> &#40;formerly, The Four Seasons&#41; is an elagent hotel located close to Lumpini Park in the middle of Bangkok which is known for it's beautifully treed grounds, lakes and walking paths. This hotel has excellent service, all the amenities such as executive lounge, pool, gym, etc. and is very close to much of the central Bangkok night-life. It also has a tram stop right outside so getting around is pretty easy from this hotel.</li>
			<li><a href="http://www.oriental-residence.com/index.aspx">Oriental Residence Bangkok</a>. If you want something a bit more modern and every bit the lap of luxury, try this place. It won't break the bank but offers all the modern amenities, design and elegance. Bright and airy design, gourmet food, relaxing pool overlooking the park... this place is a great way to let the hustle and bustle of business just melt away.</li>

		<h3>Somewhere to Dash</h3>
		<div id="Dash">
		  <ul>
			<li><b>Night Markets</b> - Bangkok is a massive city so it's no wonder that it's open-air markets or "street markets" as some would say, are impressive to say the least and they don't tend to close until after midnight if at all. Just about anything you could think of can be had here and some of them can take a full day just to walk through! Every.single.thing in these markets is "price negotiable", so as to say; never pay full price as it is a given that you are going to haggle for a better deal so they always start high. Due to Bangkok's geographical location, this can be a good place to find a great deal on things like pearls or silk wares if you are in the market for such.<br>
			There are also a small number of "floating markets" where, along with having small shops and stands, much of the commerce is conducted across boats on a waterway. You can wade through the excitement with a tour or just wander through the market and snap photos of all the colorful boats. The biggest floating markets are about an hour drive outside Bangkok proper &#40;such as Amphawa Floating Market&#41; but there are smaller, local markets such as Khlong Lat Mayom Floating Market that give you a similar experience for a lot less hassle.</li>
			<li><b>Tuk Tuk</b> - These are a small 3 wheeled vehicle that look a bit like a souped-up golf cart but they are driven on the streets and used as a sort of a taxi. The Tuk Tuk &#40;pronounced "took took" &#41; is an iconic part of Thailand and just one of many small experiences that can be had while getting from one place to another. A word of caution: Tuk Tuk drivers tend to pride themselves on being a bit wild and "kings of the road" so it isn't for the faint of heart.
			</li>
			<li><b>Tailors</b> - It seems like Bangkok has an over abundance of at least two services: massage and tailors. Nearly every city block has at least one massage parlor &#40;more on these later&#41; and one or more tailoring business. If you are in the market for beautifully custom made suits, dresses, shirts, shoes, etc., this is the place for you! As with anything, negotiate the price carefully and shop around for the best price and delivery time but you'll be hard pressed to find a better deal or quality than Bangkok's tailors!</li>
			<li><b>The Grand Palace and Wat Phra Kaew</b> - Located in Bangkok proper, the Grand Palace is the home of The King of Thailand, a palace so magnificent, it looks like something out of a dream. It is also the site of Wat Phra Kaew or the temple of the Emerald Buddha and near the enormous Reclining Buddha; both highly revered sites. There is a strict dress code here: Men must wear long pants and shirts with sleeves, no tank tops. No bare feet and women must be "modestly dressed" with no see-through clothes, bare shoulders, etc.. With all that out of the way, I highly recommend this place! It can take a half day or more to tour it all, but it is truly magnificent and like Disneyland for the shutterbug!</li>
			<li><b>The Thai Food Experience</b> - This isn't so much a particular "place" but it is certainly an experience in Thailand. While they may share the same names, Thai food dishes in Thailand taste very different than the Thai food we eat in North America. I don't know why that is, maybe the availability of different foods/spices? Either way, simply wandering around Bangkok, you will run across everything from authentic Cajun cuisine to Scottish to homemade Thai. In my opinion, the food experience alone is worth the trip! One word of caution, street food can be tasty but you can also end up in the hospital. Make sure to practice some common sense here and try to observe a location's food handling/serving practices.</li>
			<li><b>Chiang Mai</b> - This city is about an 8 hour drive North of Bangkok so it is more a trip for the ardent traveler than someone just killing time; but a great way to spend a long weekend if you find yourself in country for an extended period of time. Not only is it an ancient city in the mountainous regions of Northern Thailand &#40;making it beautiful for site seeing and photography&#41; but it boasts magnificent cultural and architectural wonders such as Wat Phra Singh. It is also a much slower pace than one would find in cities like Bangkok... you'll likely end up on an elephant ride before the trip is done!</li>

		<h3 id="PitLink">Pitfalls</h3><!-- Pitfalls -->
			<p>Thailand is a Constitutional Monarchy a bit like Great Britain. This is extremely important because the Monarchy is highly revered and <em>talking ill of them, or even in an unflattering way, can be a prison sentence!</em> As of this writing, the highly revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej recently passed-away and a successor has not yet been named &#40;although, it will likely be either his son or daughter&#41;. As an American, I tend to get loose lips as I have grown up with the protected right of free speech. That right is not officially recognized in Thailand, you would be wise to be cautious of what you say and to whom.
			</p>
			<p>As with any foreign destination, I always recommend buying a cheap pre-paid cell phone and program it with your hotel, embassy and business numbers. Use this for calls where possible as it will be cheap, and moreover; will not make you as much of a target to a nefarious pickpocket looking to exploit the vulnerability of a tourist.
			</p>
			<p>Do not expect everyone to understand English! English is a difficult language, especially for Southeast Asians, so any more than cursory "yes, no, thank you" is asking a bit much. Most places, including restaurants, will have pictures of goods and services and the employees simply carry a calculator; to show you how much you owe them, they type in a number and then hold it up to your face. If you don't like it, you type in a different number and hand it back. This will, no doubt, be in "Baht" which is the Thai currency. If you find someone fluent in English that you trust, ask a lot of questions!
			</p>
			<p>Traveling around Bangkok can get very confusing, very fast! To begin with, as soon as you reach your hotel, get a small handful of business cards and put them everywhere. Then, whenever you want to consider a new mode of transport back to your hotel, you can simply hand them the card. If they look confused, keep looking for another ride. If they know where it is, you can begin haggling over a price to get you there.
			Along with that, I would ask the hotel concierge for a local map, they usually have these with both the Thai and English equivalent names so you can embarrass yourself with a pronunciation attempt and then point to the map to direct a taxi driver. You can also use their tram system to cover larger distances. It's above ground so easy to locate and is fairly inexpensive.
			</p>
			<p>The taxis, motorcycle taxis and Tuk Tuks tend to be a pretty reliable way of getting around. That being said, they will often take you places you did not request. Local shop owners will pay taxi drivers for each person they bring to their shop so you may ask a taxi to take you to the Royal Palace or a Starbucks and they'll take you to a tailor shop where you will be worked over to buy something, and believe me, the shop owners in Bangkok are extremely aggressive sales-people! I have been followed for 2 blocks by shop owners simply because I spent 30 seconds looking through the shop window! When bartering with a Taxi driver, demand the meter and make it clear, no side stops.
			</p>
			<p>Another major industry that Thailand is famous for is sex tourism. I have a low opinion of this "industry" so I can't be of any help to someone hoping to take advantage of it. That being said, I will warn you of a few pitfalls. There is a lot of poverty in Thailand. In an effort to escape poverty some take to prostitution while others sell-off or exploit the young and the vulnerable to this deplorable trade. It seems as if every city block of Bangkok has a massage parlor. Some are legit and only do massage; many offer... other services... so be clear as to what it is you expect if you enter one. Bangkok also has a "red-light area" that is as seedy as anything you've ever seen in a movie with the exploitation of often underage boys and girls. You'll know the area if you enter it as there are street carts with all manner of sexually explicit content and sex workers making cat-calls and offers from every doorway. This place can be very dangerous to the tourist for a number of reasons so I strongly advise you to avoid them. If you choose to go this route, remember two important things: 1&#41; people here are not always what they seem and 2&#41; if someone is willing to exploit another person for profit, they will have no more respect for the wayward traveler and may exploit you as well!

		 <h3>Observations</h3>
		    <p>I've done my fair share of exploring in this city so here are some tidbits that might help take the guess-work out of getting around.
		    </p>
			<p>First and foremost: NEVER pay full price! If they think you're a foreigner, they automatically quote you double as you are obviously rich and can spare it. Always begin price negotiations by cutting the quoted price in half and then haggle from there.
			</p>
		    <p>Thais are predominantly buddhist and use a greeting that is also somewhat of a blessing by placing their hands together in front of their chest and bowing slightly while saying something that sounds most like: "sawatdi" &#40;pronounced "say-watt-dee"&#41; followed by "khrap" &#40;pronounced "crop"&#41; if spoken by a male and "kha" if spoken by a female. It is always said when entering or leaving a house. They don't expect it but certainly appreciate when a westerner returns the courtesy.
			</p>
			<p>Thai currency is the Baht &#40; THB &#41;. As of this writing, the exchange rate is somewhere in the ballpark of $.03 or 35 Baht to $1 USD. The minimum wage is around 300 THB/day or $8.50 USD.
			</p>
			<p>Drug smuggling is punishable by death.
			</p>
			<p>Like most S.E. Asian countries, people take their shoes off indoors. It is considered disrespectful to point your toes at someone or display the bottom of your feet. This is especially so with a portrait or effigy of Buddha!
			</p>
			<p>It's hot in Thailand. In Bangkok, temperatures tend to hang between 80°F and 95°F around the clock. On top of that, they have a pretty significant pollution problem so smog is ever present.
			</p>
			<p>Drink bottled water. There is not much in the way of good water treatment here.
			</p>
			<p>Many hotels will not allow you to bring durian fruit inside should you be one of those select few who can actually get past the smell to taste it.
			</p>			
			<p>Tuk Tuk are fun to ride in.</p>
