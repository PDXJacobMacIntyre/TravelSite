			<p><span style="font-size: 24px"><b>Intro:</b></span> World travel is exciting and at times, even scary. Unlike the typical tourist, business travelers often find themselves making travel plans to an unknown destination with little or no time to really prepare.</p>
			
			<p>This site aims to give such travelers a "Flashcard view" of what to expect when they hit the ground in one of 3 places linked above as well as some suggestions to help make the trip a little more interesting!</p>
			  
			<h2>How this site works:</h2>
			<p>Select a link from the navigation bar to go to the page for a given locale. In each locale, you will find the following categories:</p>
  </article>
	  
  <section>
			<h3>Places to Crash</h3><!-- The Crash -->
			<p><i>Here are some recommendations for hotels, hostels, bed & breakfast, etc.. They are based on little more than my own experiences and tastes vary widely in this area so if nothing else, do what you can to find the best accommodations you can afford.</i>
			</p>
	  
			<h3>Somewhere to Dash</h3><!-- The Dash -->
			<p><i>These are a few places that I found interesting and think that other travelers would enjoy as well. Most countries / major cities have tourist resources available online so if you find yourself sitting in an airport with free wi-fi and some time to kill, it might be a good time to do some digging.</i>
			</p>

			<h3>Some Camera Flash</h3><!-- Some Flash? -->
			<p><i>Here, I'll post a few pictures of different subjects related to the location.</i>
			</p>

			<h3>Pitfalls</h3><!-- Pitfalls -->
			<p><i>An important part of any trip is knowing things to avoid. This could be anything from local customs and ethnic traditions to food, bad neighborhoods, crime and above all; careless assumptions! Naturally, I can't list them all. I'd recommend a far better travel guide than this site to really get the details, but hopefully this section will help you keep from making an avoidable mistake.</i>
			</p>

  <aside><!-- an aside with side info, personal experiences, money types, taxi, etc. -->
	      <div id="Sidebar">
		    <h3>Observations</h3>
		      <p>In this column, I'll list some general observations about things like food, culture, customs, money and the people that I think would be useful to a traveler that has never visited the location... or I might just be writing something funny...
		      </p>
		      <p>Every location has it's own idiosyncrasies and unique traits; I will place some of them here.</p>
			  <p>An important thing to remember, no matter what the destination; when traveling out of the country, make certain you learn the address and phone number to your country's embassy as well as it's location relative to your accommodations. You never know when you may need to find it with little or no notice.
