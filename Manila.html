	<h2>An introduction to Manila</h2>
		<p>Many countries have found a lot of value in outsourcing to the Philippines. From manufacturing to call centers, the low labor and overhead costs coupled with close proximity to suppliers &#40;China, Korea, etc.&#41; make the Philippines a very attractive option for business.
		</p>
		<p>Manila, located on the "mainland" island of Luzon, is the capital of the Philippines and metro-Manila is home to nearly 90 million of it's inhabitants. Makati is Manila's business district and very upscale; some call it &#34;Manhattan of the Philippines&#34; with all of it's sky scrapers and high-end shopping.
		</p>
		<p> Despite the very successful business districts, beautiful country side, tropical beaches and kind nature of it's people; the Philippines is also an extremely populous and relatively poor country which lends itself to a respectable crime element. You would be hard pressed to find a friendlier people than Filipinos but desperation being what it is; you had best have some street smarts if you're going on a walkabout and you'd be wise to always travel with a friend, preferably a local to be on the safe side.

		<h3>Places to Crash</h3>
		<div id="Crash">
		  <ol>
			<li><a href="http://manila.newworldhotels.com/en/">New World Makati Hotel</a> is a five star hotel in the very heart of downtown Makati. Luxurious accommodations, crackin  service and a stones throw from the high-end shops, malls and restaurants.</li>
			<li><a href="http://manila.peninsula.com/en/default">The Peninsula Manila Hotel</a> is an outstanding five star hotel, also near the heart of downtown Makati. It's pretty tough to get any fancier than this place! If you can imagine it, they have it!</li>
			<li><a href="http://viverehotel.com.ph/home0.html">Vivere Hotel Alabang</a>. If you would like to spend a little less but stay in the realm of 4 stars, this hotel is a great choice. Set in the middle of the city of Alabang &#40;about 30-40 mins. drive from Makati&#41;, this hotel has all the amenities such as open-air roof lounge/restaurant, swimming, massage, executive meeting rooms, etc. and couples it with outstanding service. It's also within walking distance of two major shopping malls with a variety of restaurants. This location tends to save about 45 mins. to 1 hr. of travel time if your destination is an industrial area in Cavite or Batangas.</li>

		<h3>Somewhere to Dash</h3>
		<div id="Dash">
		  <ul>
			<li><b>Greenbelt 5</b> - This is an extremely large mall-type complex in the heart of Makati with everything from Breitling dealers to snow-cones. The enclosed but open-air food court is quite the happening place once the sun goes down and has a massive variety of restaurants in every flavor.</li>
			<li><b>Manila Ocean Park</b> - A massive aquatic park with live animal shows &#40;dolphins, sea lions, etc.&#41;, underwater viewing of sea life to include a LOT of sharks, rays and jellyfish&#59; and a food court / gift shops. You can easily burn up a whole day here!</li>
			<li><b>Taal Volcano, Tagaytay</b> - If you're more of the outdoorsy type, a trip to the beautiful &#40;and slightly cooler&#41; city of Tagaytay is always a treat. Along the way there are numerous local treats such as farm stands, wood carvers, restaurants and the like. Once there, you can take a small "pump boat" to land-locked Taal Volcano and ride a VERY small pony to the top or mouth of the volcano for magnificent views of the area. At 6'4", I'm a bit big for ponies so I hiked it and enjoyed every step so that's always an option.</li>
			<li><b>Corregidor Island</b> - For the military/history buffs there is the haunting island of Corregidor in Manila Bay. It was the site of brutal WWII battles between 1942 and 1945 where the Japanese took the island and then later lost it to a return assault by the US. There are still embattlements and structures that stand as ghostly, shell riddled testaments to some of the fiercest fighting of the WWII pacific theatre.</li>

		<h3>Pitfalls</h3><!-- Pitfalls -->
			<p>First and foremost, buy a cheap pre-paid cell phone and program it with your hotel, embassy and business numbers. Use this for calls where possible as it will be cheap, and moreover; will not make you as much of a target to "snatchers" &#40;small teams of pick-pockets&#41; as something like an iPhone will.
			</p>
			<p>Metro Manila, like any major city, has some high crime areas. It is best that you don't venture out without a guide, at least until you get to know the place. 
			</p>
			<p>It is not recommended that you ride in Taxis as they are a favorite target for muggings or kidnappings. Most hotels have their own taxis or shuttles run by verified employees and a log of their passengers. If you must ride in a taxi or "tricycle", user your cell phone to take a photo of it and the driver and text/e-mail it to a friend.
			</p>
			<p>Manila has some great food, but they do not have the same health codes that western countries do. Whether it be eating from a vending cart, a fast-food restaurant or even some place familiar like an Outback Steakhouse; it is prudent to avoid foods that aren't cooked in some way like raw vegetables or chopped fruit. Also, there is no potable municipal water source anywhere in metro-Manila. All water must be filtered/bottled, that includes ice cubes! Avoid eating ice, even in a soft drink; it was likely made with municipal water.
			</p>
			<p>Always count your change. When you buy something, no matter what it is, do the math yourself and know how much you should pay. Also, try to avoid the temptation of buying imitation name-brand or black market items such as designer clothes. Japan's airports are a gateway to and from the Philippines and they are VERY good and identifying and confiscating any imitation / black market items. You'll lose your money, your stuff and likely miss your flight.
			</p>
			<p>Filipinos respond well to kindness and have a sort of "passive aggressive" reaction to coercion or force. Put another way; if you try to badger or intimidate a Filipino into doing something, it's like hitting the proverbial off-button. This is particularly important to business people because westerners tend to push harder when things don't go our way or to stress importance. There is no faster way to accomplish nothing when it comes to Filipinos. Kindness and some humility will accomplish far more, 99% of the time.

		 <h3>Observations</h3>
		    <p>Okay, not only have I spent a considerable amount of time in this country, I also happen to be married to a Filipina, so here are a few tidbits I've picked up that you might find interesting and/or helpful:
		    </p>
			<p>Filipinos are very polite, amiable, and hardworking; generally speaking. You would be hard pressed to find a country with more smiles.
			</p>
		    <p>Filipinos point with their lips in a "smoochy" gesture, not their fingers.
			</p>
			<p>Philippine currency is the "Philippine Peso" or PHP. An average minimum wage in metro-Manila is in the ballpark of $8-10 USD/day &#40;PHP 480&#41;, significantly less in the provinces. Generous tips go a long way!
			</p>
			<p>Most people in Asia-Pacific have little concept of "personal space", the Philippines is no exception so don't be offended if people regularly push past you or stand close enough to rub shoulders; it's just what they do. You should be on your guard for pick-pockets who exploit this trait.
			</p>
			<p>The country is predominantly Roman Catholic and there is little separation between Church and State.
			</p>
			<p>Filipinos don't curl their finger toward their face to gesture "come here". They swat downward with an open hand like when a person doggie-paddles.
			</p>
			<p>The temperature in Manila doesn't go much below 75°F at any given time, averages about 85°F and can get to around 98°F or higher in their summer... and it's about 80% relative humidity so dress accordingly and drink a lot of water!
			</p>			
			<p>Tagalog is the primary or common language out of nearly 200 dialects in the Philippines. It is not gender specific, therefor; Filipinos regularly mix up the personal pronouns "he and she". It'll throw ya if you're not paying attention!
			</p>
			<p>Jeepneys are fun to ride in.</p>
